THAT DOG WAS FOLLOWING ME ALL DAY
EVEN I HATE ME SOMETIMES
THE FLOWERS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THEY SMELL NICE
JAVA PROGRAMMING IS EASIER THAN C PROGRAMMING
FAITH IS A STATE OF OPENNESS OR TRUST
PEOPLE LIVING DEEPLY HAVE NO FEAR OF DEATH
STUDY SMARTER NOT HARDER
TO BE HEALTHY DO YOUR EXERCISES
THE DOCTOR WAS BUSY TODAY
ALL THE ITEMS IN THE STORE SOLD OUT
ALL THE RESTAURANTS IN THE TOWN ARE CLOSED
IT IS COLD IN THE WINTER BUT IT IS WARM IN THE SUMMER
HASKELL IS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE 
WE WERE ALL HAPPY
I BOUGHT YOU A GIFT FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY
STAY INSIDE YOUR HOME TO BE SAFE
